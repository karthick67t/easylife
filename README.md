# EasyLife — Adaptive Accessibility Platform for Older Adults (60+)

> *"Don't learn the interface. Let the interface learn you."*

**EasyLife** is an adaptive, accessibility-first digital companion platform engineered for older adults (60+) and individuals with limited digital literacy, visual or hearing impairments, cognitive challenges, or language preferences. Instead of forcing elderly users to adapt to complicated technology, EasyLife dynamically adapts the interface, text scaling, speech synthesis, contrast, and assistance level to match the user's preferred way of interacting.

## 🎯 Problem Statement & Target Audience

### **The Target Group**: Older Adults Aged 60+
Many older adults face immense friction when interacting with conventional technology:
- **Small typography & poor contrast**: Eye strain from 12px secondary fonts and low-contrast grey text.
- **Technical jargon**: Confusion caused by bureaucratic terms like *"disbursement"*, *"annuity"*, and *"supporting documentation"*.
- **Memory load**: Anxiety from remembering medical schedules, doctor appointment dates, and complex login credentials.
- **Fear of making mistakes**: Paralysis caused by fear of clicking wrong buttons or causing accidental financial loss.
- **Digital scams & fraud**: Vulnerability to urgent phishing SMS, suspicious bank warnings, and OTP theft.
- **Language barriers**: Digital portals defaulting strictly to complex English without local context.

### **The EasyLife Solution**
EasyLife acts as an **adaptive accessibility layer** over everyday digital services:
1. **Light Green + White Public-Service Aesthetic**: Built with Apple-level simplicity (`#F8FAF8` background, `#FFFFFF` cards, `#16834B` primary green, `#CFE8DA` borders).
2. **Adaptive Experience Engine**: Dynamically scales text (18px–26px), enforces high contrast, activates read-aloud speech, and switches language context (**English, Tamil, Hindi, Malayalam, Telugu**).
3. **Plain Language Jargon Transformer ("Explain This")**: Converts official legal/government text into 1-sentence everyday language.
4. **Visual Task Guide ("Show Me")**: Step-by-step interactive workflow guidance.
5. **Message Safety Checker ("Scam Shield")**: Educational assistant detecting urgent keywords, link risks, and OTP safety rules.
6. **Instant Recovery ("I'm Stuck")**: One-tap persistent helper offering plain-language recovery options without judgment.
7. **Daily Timeline ("My Day")**: Memory-friendly vertical schedule organizing appointments, medicines, and check-ins.
8. **Caregiver Privacy Controls ("Trusted Circle")**: Quick family calling (Priya & Arun) while strictly restricting banking access by default.
